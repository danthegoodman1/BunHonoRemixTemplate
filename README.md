## Bun frozen lockfile error

If you get this when trying to install (specifically on docker build) just run `bun install` again and it should update the lockfile.

## Auth

Oauth2 was pretty easy to add with https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-auth and https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-auth-oauth2

See `huggingface-auth` branch of `sellmyai` to see a frozen implementation of it working with the cookieSession.
